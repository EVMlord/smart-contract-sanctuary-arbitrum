 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
