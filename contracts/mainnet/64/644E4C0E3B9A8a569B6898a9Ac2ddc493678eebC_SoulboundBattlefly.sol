 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/**
 * All of Battlefly's wastelands storage is stored in a single WastelandStorage struct.
 *
 * The Diamond Storage pattern (https://dev.to/mudgen/how-diamond-storage-works-90e)
 * is used to set the struct at a specific place in contract storage. The pattern
 * recommends that the hash of a specific namespace (e.g. "battlefly.storage.game")
 * be used as the slot to store the struct.
 *
 * Additionally, the Diamond Storage pattern can be used to access and change state inside
 * of Library contract code (https://dev.to/mudgen/solidity-libraries-can-t-have-state-variables-oh-yes-they-can-3ke9).
 * Instead of using `LibStorage.wastelandStorage()` directly, a Library will probably
 * define a convenience function to accessing state, similar to the `gs()` function provided
 * in the `WithStorage` base contract below.
 *
 * This pattern was chosen over the AppStorage pattern (https://dev.to/mudgen/appstorage-pattern-for-state-variables-in-solidity-3lki)
 * because AppStorage seems to indicate it doesn't support additional state in contracts.
 * This becomes a problem when using base contracts that manage their own state internally.
 *
 * There are a few caveats to this approach:
 * 1. State must always be loaded through a function (`LibStorage.gameStorage()`)
 *    instead of accessing it as a variable directly. The `WithStorage` base contract
 *    below provides convenience functions, such as `gs()`, for accessing storage.
 * 2. Although inherited contracts can have their own state, top level contracts must
 *    ONLY use the Diamond Storage. This seems to be due to how contract inheritance
 *    calculates contract storage layout.
 * 3. The same namespace can't be used for multiple structs. However, new namespaces can
 *    be added to the contract to add additional storage structs.
 * 4. If a contract is deployed using the Diamond Storage, you must ONLY ADD fields to the
 *    very end of the struct during upgrades. During an upgrade, if any fields get added,
 *    removed, or changed at the beginning or middle of the existing struct, the
 *    entire layout of the storage will be broken.
 * 5. Avoid structs within the Diamond Storage struct, as these nested structs cannot be
 *    changed during upgrades without breaking the layout of storage. Structs inside of
 *    mappings are fine because their storage layout is different. Consider creating a new
 *    Diamond storage for each struct.
 *
 * More information on Solidity contract storage layout is available at:
 * https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html
 *
 * Nick Mudge, the author of the Diamond Pattern and creator of Diamond Storage pattern,
 * wrote about the benefits of the Diamond Storage pattern over other storage patterns at
 * https://medium.com/1milliondevs/new-storage-layout-for-proxy-contracts-and-diamonds-98d01d0eadb#bfc1
