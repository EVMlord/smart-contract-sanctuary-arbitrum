 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
