 * contracts deployed on the child chain to interact with this contract as an Oracle. Moreover, this contract gives
 * child chain contracts the ability to trigger cross-chain price requests to the mainnet DVM. This Spoke knows how
 * to communicate with the parent chain via a "ChildMessenger" contract which directly communicates with the
 * "ParentMessenger" on mainnet.
 * @dev The intended client of this contract is an OptimisticOracle on sidechain that needs price
 * resolution secured by the DVM on mainnet.
